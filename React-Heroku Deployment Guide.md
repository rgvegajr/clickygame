# Deployment

In this activity we will deploy the React Reading List application to Heroku.

## Instructions

* Deploy the React Reading List application to Heroku. Make sure to perform the following:

  * Initialize the project folder as a git repo (`git init`).

  * Create a Heroku app for the React Reading List App.

  * Add a MongoLab Addon for the React Reading List Heroku app.
	
  * Add Heroku as a remote in your terminal. (You can also add the Github remote after this step too)

  * Add and commit your changes before pushing up to heroku.

### Hints

* Make sure you add and commit all changes before pushing up to Heroku.

* If your deployment fails, run `heroku logs` while in the project directory. This should print all of the logs produced from the failed deployment. Usually the issue can be found at the start of any errors.

* You can check if you successfully added Heroku as a remote by running `git remote -v` in your terminal.
